# 1-2-3-Remember-me

1 2 3 Remember me is a memory based game where you get given the locations of cards you have to memorise with an increasing difficulty.

This game was mostly made during the Covid-19 quarantine to help get myself a better understand and experience the difficulties/differences it takes to not only develop a game for mobile, but everything that comes inbetween, e.g. adding a Ads system, dealing with mobile testing, ect.

This was done mainly for personal development/experience but to also show future employers my ability to want to learn more.
